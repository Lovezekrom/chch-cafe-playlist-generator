The aim of this project was to generate a music playlist of New Zealand artists\bands based on Christchurch cafe names. This playlist would be used by the Christchurch cafe owners to have music by our people playing as we drink coffee. This was done using the R programming language we learnt in the labs and the new techniques we taught ourselves. We believe we were successful in satisfying our project aim and are happy with the outcome.
